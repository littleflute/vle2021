Bird flu outbreak

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:14,592
The largest number of influenza cases is in Japan

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,384
And South Korea

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
In those countries

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
20 million chickens have been destroyed

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,320
Since November

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,648
Outbreaks have been reported

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,720
Over a wide area in Japan

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
During the past

00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
2 months

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
Chiba near Tokyo

Has reported cases and there are reports of the disease

Are still happening

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,880
We can't say risk of the further spread of bird flu

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
Has diminished

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,024
As the migration season for wild birds will continue

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
Until March

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120

00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,568
The case was discovered in Japan and South Korea

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
Are similar to viruses

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
That spread through Europe

30
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
In 2019

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,856
Those viruses developed from widespread infections

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648

At this time of year

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Because of migratory bird movements

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,712
Now new forms of the virus

42
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Has evolved

43
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,576
To become more deadly in wild birds

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
This puts

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,208
Countries on flight Pathways at risk

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Experts say

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Last week

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,632
The a h5n8 virus reached

In 10 Indian States

56
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,784

To the FAO

60
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
He added that there is a lot of public

61
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
Fear about disease in Crows

62
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
Which can fly long distances

63
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
They know they fly far

64
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
And think they'll infect their poultry

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Or even people

66
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200

00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736

1/3 last week

69
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
As people became increasingly fearful of the disease

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,440
And stayed away from the meat

71
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,560
Bird flu cannot infect people who eat the meat

72
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,632
And the h5 N8 virus

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Is not known to have infected humans

74
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,288
But people are still fearful

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336

Based in the Western Indian city of nashik

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,672
Indonesia is Asia's second largest poultry producer

80
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,816
The country is only a temporary Transit point for wild birds

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,168
This has reduced the risk of infections

82
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
An official at the country's agriculture Ministry said

83
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
However

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:02,432
Indonesia still to Ban live imports from countries

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Cases

88
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
And

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Set up a surveillance

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
System

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904
To look for early signs of the virus

92
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:18,047
With no major bird flight Pathways over Southeast Asia

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Countries like Vietnam

94
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,471
Laos and Cambodia have so far not had H5

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
N8 outbreaks

96
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,847
Those Nations could however

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,455
Face risks from the movement of people and goods

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,319
The Asian outbreak comes as the world faces

99
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
The covid-19 pandemic

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
It hurt poultry sales early on

101
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,839
But the pandemic has also driven poultry demand up

102
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,679
As more people facing virus restrictions

103
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Turn

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
To home cooking
